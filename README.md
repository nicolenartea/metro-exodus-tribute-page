HI! Welcome to the Read ME! page :D 

PROJECT TITLE: METRO EXODUS tribute page

Objective: 
-even though it's a tribute page, it is just a test in creating html emails
-creating responsive tables to different screen sizes
-compatibility to different email clients (check https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/)
-coding in pure HTML to avoid CSS in-line errors (hopefully)

Languages used:
-html

Things I used:
-Atom v 1.27.2
-https://tinypng.com/
-https://postimages.org/

Issues:
-better way to present the pictures (should I just put it in a sliding gallery?)
-make the tables MORE responsive to screen size
-other things I should take note of (client-perspective demands i.e. more pictures, links, buttons etc.)


Pull Requests are always welcome, so are constructive advise.

I do not own Metro Exodus, they are made by studio 4A Games and published by Deep Silver
nor do I own Valve.
