Hi! Welcome to the read me page! :hand:

I have been working on creating an example of a pure html (*with sprinkles of CSS*) for potential clients
and for html-email advertising!

Resources: 
- https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/ 
- https://putsmail.com/

Text Editor used:
- Atom v 1.27.2
- Sublime v 3.1.1

Pull Requests are always welcome, so are constructive advise. I would also need help in more tips/tricks/tutorials on media queries, CSS grid or flexbox including responsive web design in different screens
